RED Teams SUITS submission for the 22-23 SUITS challenge.

Contributing
When beginning work on a new feature:

Create a new branch off of main or dev, using the naming convention titled [issue-number]-[description] (Example: 25-repository-setup).
Develop on this branch until the feature is complete.
Merge any changes from dev into the branch.
Create a pull request into dev for the feature, filling out the provided template.
When dev is stable, create a pull request for dev into main.
NOTE: If your feature requires any changes to a scene, before beginning development on the feature you should duplicate the scene in question. While working on the feature, you should only make changes to this scene, and not the original. Once you are ready to create the pull request, merge in any changes from the main branch as normal, and only then should you copy your changes back into the original scene. This will prevent merge conflicts in scenes, which can be extremely difficult to resolve otherwise.

MORTI(Multi Observation Reality Tool and Interface) is an Augmented Reality tool to support astronauts in the current Artemis missions to the lunar surface. It operates in a Microsoft Hololens environment, with UI and tools to assist with mission specific directives, navigation, and bioinformatics tracking.

What is NASA SUITS?
NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) challenges students to design and create spacesuit information displays within augmented reality (AR) environments. As NASA pursues Artemis - landing American astronauts on the Moon, the agency will accelerate investing in surface architecture and technology development. For exploration, it is essential that crewmembers on spacewalks are equipped with the appropriate human-autonomy enabling technologies necessary for the elevated demands of lunar surface exploration and extreme terrestrial access. The SUITS 2023 Challenges target key aspects of the Artemis mission.
